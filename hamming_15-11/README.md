## hamming

A simple hamming(15,11) implementation

![](./hamming.jpg)

Was tested by connecting hamming_set, hamming_detect, and hamming_correct together, setting an input, and making sure it matched the output. No further testing has been done yet.

- hamming_set - Takes in 4 bits of data and gives a proper hamming code.

- hamming_detect - Takes in a hamming code and gives back either the error location (if there's one error) or if there was a double error (in which it will set error location to zero).

- hamming_correct - Takes in a hamming code and error location and corrects it, giving back the original 4 bits of data.
