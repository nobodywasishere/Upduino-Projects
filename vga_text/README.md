## vga_text

An ASCII character set with C64 font and text buffer that outputs to a 768p VGA display. Using too many characters causes weird artifacts, unsure why. Only has A-Z currently mapped. Need to redo text buffer using the device RAM directly as I believe this is what's causing the problems.
